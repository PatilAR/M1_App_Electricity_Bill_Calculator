## Electricity Bill Calculator

A Calculator is a small electronic device used to perform various arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, percentage, etc. Also the electricity bill calculator is also the one which calculates and helps the user to enter the units that a meter has consumed.

# Research:-

We use a basic operations and help the users to calculate the number of units consumed by the electricity meter from specific fields.

## a)	 5 years Ago Calculator :- 
- This is the old version of calculator 
- The cost of units in those days were a bit low to the customers depending on the units used and charge per unit fixed. 
- It as used to perform the basic operation on different fields like agriculture, residential, commercial.
## b)	 New Generation Calculator 

- Modern electronic calculators vary from cheap, give-away, credit-card-sized models to sturdy desktop models with built-in printers 
- The cost of bills now have changed drastically and unit prices are high, for even normal usage of a 1BHK the bill goes around 300Rs. 

# Defining Our System:-

This is a basic electricty bill calculator used to calculathe units consumed by various different fields.

# SWOT ANALYSIS:-

SWOT Analysis is a simple tool that can help you to analyze what your company does best right now, and to devise a successful strategy for the future. SWOT can also reveal areas of the business that are holding you back, or that your competitors could exploit if you don't protect yourself.

## a) Strengths

Strengths are things that your Calculators does particularly well, or in a way that distinguishes you from your competitors

## b) Weaknesses

Weaknesses, like strengths, are inherent features of your projects, so focus on your people, resources, systems, and procedures.

## c) Opportunity

They usually arise from situations outside your organization, and require an eye to what might happen in the future.

## d) Threats

Threats include anything that can negatively affect your business from the outside, such as supply-chain problems, shifts in market requirements, or a shortage of recruits.
